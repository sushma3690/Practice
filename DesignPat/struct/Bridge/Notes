Bridge pattern
 ---- make an abstarct class and its implementation totally indepent of each oter using 
 an interface
 
 -- avoid bidning between an abstartcion and implementation, should each be extensible
 
 -- hide implementation of abstratcion completely from clients
 
 -- interface -> acts as a bridge between abstraction class n impl vlass
 
 -- bp allows abstract n impl to b modified without impacting other
 
 -- hide impl of abs completely from clients
