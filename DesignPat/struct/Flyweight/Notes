used to reduce memory foot print
string pool uses fly weight
if an object alreayd exists with same data returns it fr this ref else creates new

The Flyweight pattern is concerned with reducing the strain on the JVM and its memory. This is crucial for devices without much memory, as well as optimization of the application.

When a certain application needs to create many instances of the same class, a common pool is created so that similar ones can be reused, instead of created each time.

The most well-known implementation of this design pattern is the String Pool in Java. Strings are used perhaps more often than any other object in the language and thus, they consumed a large portion of the resources. By creating a pool of common Strings and assigning multiple reference variables to the ones with the same content, and only creating new Strings when no match is found made a huge impact on the performance of Java.

recognizeable by creational methods returning a cached instance, a bit the "multiton" idea)

-127 to 127 will be stored in an array and returned. same for other types too
